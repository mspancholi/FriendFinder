# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers



This app is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder". This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

The app uses Express to handle routing. The app is deployed in Heroku so other users can fill it out. 

Here is the Heroku link:
